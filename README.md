There will be merge conflicts, so do check out the resources here of how to resolve them:

- [youtube vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmKdodJU-js)
- [blog](https://leonardomontini.dev/merge-conflict-vscode/)
- [vscode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)

Whenever you want to sync with the main branch, get the latest main branch and then merge it with your branch. This will help you to avoid merge conflicts.

```bash
# in your local branch, even if your changes doens't affect the main
# we would still do this to not stash changes
git add .
git commit -m "messages"
git push

# after clean the status of your local, now check out the main branch
git checkout main
git fetch && git pull

# now go back to your branch and merge the main branch
git checkout your-branch

# at this point you have two options
# 1. merge the main branch with your branch
git merge --no-ff main

# 2. rebase the main branch with your branch
git rebase main
```

That's it! You are now up to date with the main branch. Now submit and write that sweet PR.

## Git Commit Convention
1. Use present tense in your commit messages. For example, use "‚ú®feature: Add xyz to component qrs" instead of "‚ú®feature: Added xyz to component qrs". ([Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages))
2. Use the emojis below to distinguish what type of change you have made in your commit. This will help keep commit messages consistent and easier to read. For example, "üìödocs: Update commit conventions in README.md".
- ‚ú®**feature**: Introduces completely new code or new features.
- üêõ**fix**: Implements changes that fix a bug. Ideally, reference an issue if present.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è**refactor**: Includes any code-related change that is neither a fix nor a feature.
- ‚úÖ**build**: Encompasses all changes related to the build of the software, including changes to dependencies or the addition of new ones.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è**test**: Pertains to all changes regarding tests, whether adding new tests or modifying existing ones.
- üö∞**ci**: Involves all changes related to the configuration of continuous integration, such as GitHub Actions or other CI systems.
- üìö**docs**: Includes all changes to documentation, such as README files, or any other documentation present in the repository.
- üóëÔ∏è**chore**: Captures all changes to the repository that do not fit into the above categories.
