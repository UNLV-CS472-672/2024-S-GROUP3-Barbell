## Resolve Merge Conflicts

There will be merge conflicts, so do check out the resources here of how to resolve them:

- [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmKdodJU-js)
- [blog](https://leonardomontini.dev/merge-conflict-vscode/)
- [vscode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)

Whenever you want to sync with the main branch, get the latest main branch and then merge it with your branch. This will help you to avoid merge conflicts. There is some funny tools can help you with this 
as well.

```bash
# in your local branch, even if your changes doens't affect the main
# we would still do this to not stash changes
git add .
git commit -m "messages"
git push

# after clean the status of your local, now check out the main branch
git checkout main
git fetch && git pull

# now go back to your branch and merge the main branch
git checkout your-branch

# at this point you have two options
# 1. merge the main branch with your branch
git merge --no-ff main

# 2. rebase the main branch with your branch
git rebase main
```

That's it! You are now up to date with the main branch. Now submit and write that sweet PR.

## Git Commit Convention

1. Use present tense in your commit messages. For example, use "‚ú®feature: Add xyz to component qrs" instead of "‚ú®feature: Added xyz to component qrs". ([Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3580013/should-i-use-past-or-present-tense-in-git-commit-messages))

2. Use the emojis below to distinguish what type of change you have made in your commit. This will help keep commit messages consistent and easier to read. For example, "üìödocs: Update commit conventions in README.md".
- ‚ú®feature: Introduces completely new code or new features.
- üêõfix: Implements changes that fix a bug. Ideally, reference an issue if present.
- ‚ôªÔ∏èrefactor: Includes any code-related change that is neither a fix nor a feature.
- ‚úÖbuild: Encompasses all changes related to the build of the software, including changes to dependencies or the addition of new ones.
- ‚ö°Ô∏ètest: Pertains to all changes regarding tests, whether adding new tests or modifying existing ones.
- üö∞ci: Involves all changes related to the configuration of continuous integration, such as GitHub Actions or other CI systems.
- üìödocs: Includes all changes to documentation, such as README files, or any other documentation present in the repository.
- üóëÔ∏èchore: Captures all changes to the repository that do not fit into the above categories.
